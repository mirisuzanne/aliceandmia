[ 08.10    Mia: genderqueer, not clear on her own gender, etc. Is there a published story for this? ]
[ 08.25 Mia: Lesbian, bi, or pan? Story link? ]
[ 09.10    Mia: Femme-of-centre presentation...story about ? ]

[ 11.05    Appreciating that we’re all navigating the ‘new’ gender landscape from a place of ignorance and trial-and-error.  Humility and awareness are key. ]

12.20    Actually, Mia does say she’s a trans woman in the stories Alice read. Alice is a ditz.

[ Self-identification vs external (TruTrans). Story? ]

21.18    Mia wrote about the language around trans and gender identity: https://medium.com/@mirisuzanne/some-clarifications-on-trans-language-4757f1464796

There are a lot of trans / gender glossaries out there, and all of them have problems born of a) the rapidly changing nature of the language around gender, and b) the inevitable biases of the authors.  With those caveats, one of the better glossaires available is that by Julia Serano.

22.19    ‘A man or woman of trans history…’, the one Alice couldn’t remember is ‘...of trans experience.’

22.38    Alice wrote about the problem with ‘normal’ in ‘We’re just normal, why do you call us cis?’

22.55    Queer theory ‘focuses on mismatches between sex, gender and desire’. —Annamarie Jagose, from Queer Theory: An Introduction.

26.34    Alice ‘popped out into the trans community in June of 2016’: https://medium.com/p/the-kindness-of-strangers-75844656e643

27.52    Kate Bornstein was indeed ‘around at about that time’ (late 1980s), transitioning three years before Alice in 1986.  She became publicly visible beginning in the 1990s—her famous appearance on the Geraldo Rivera Show was ‘1992-ish’, according to her—thus ‘shortly thereafter’.

30.02    For a good portion of those 27 years Alice kind of wasn’t white and def wasn’t living in suburbia (but was she ‘cis’?).

32.20    Twined Fragments is an ongoing collaboration between authors Allison Washington and Miriam Suzanne. Each fragment is sparked by the previous, as two trans women pass their memories back and forth, reflecting on lives and transitions separated by a generation.

36.20    Dame Judy Dench:

38.50    The Knowledge Effect or Prior Knowledge Effect is a special case of hindsight bias and the curse of knowledge cognitive biases; wherein once someone knows something, they cannot imagine not knowing that thing.  This effect is central to a trans person’s inability to determine whether or not they are ‘passing’: Once you ask, then the person knows, and then has trouble imagining that they did not know (they minimise their previous lack of knowledge).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge

This is illustrated by a game Alice calls Spot the Tranny: In a public place with women around, choose any woman who is, shall we say, ‘non-Barbiesque’.  Now say to yourself ‘that there is a trans woman’.  You will now begin to pick out increasingly obvious ‘tells’—height, hand size, larynx, hairline, jawline, brow, shoulders—practically against your will. Even just pretending you ‘know’ invokes the curse of knowledge. There is, of course, only a 6/1000 chance that the poor dear is, in fact, a trans woman.

(At the other extreme, good luck finding tells on Carmen Carrera. So if you think you see a trans woman...the chances are quite good that you don’t.)

Carmen Carrera: what trans women really look like.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Carrera

And whilst we’re here, another cognitive bias that plays a huge role in the marginalisation of trans people is Confirmation Bias: the tendency to search for, interpret, focus on, and remember information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias

41.10    Alice transitioned at 32, but ‘you were also four’:
Alice wrote about growing up as a girl in her Girl series. She was de-transitioned by her father in 1971 at age 14, thereafter living sometimes ‘as a man’ (a.k.a. ‘Boy mode’), sometimes in a semi-female-presenting, ambiguously gendered state, until she re-transitioned, socially and medically, in 1989. https://medium.com/athena-talks/i-girl-begun-why-my-mother-raised-me-as-a-girl-3005132df0b8

44.58    Neural rewiring / cortical remapping. When sensory input ceases (as from amputation) there can be a period of ‘ghost’ sensation (phantom limb; and yes, this can happen with you-know-what), then over time the neural ‘circuits’ get reused for other things and we lose the ability to remember how those sensory inputs once felt; to the point that Alice cannot remember what it felt like to have a beard or...yea, that.

[ 46.50    Electrolysis ]

48.40    The shopping scene: Julia Serano tells a nearly identical story in Whipping Girl. This exact scene is probably something that plays out for many transitioning trans women.

49.50    Can you imagine this with a beard?  :-D

Inspiration for the Alice & Mia show came from working together on the Twined Fragments project combined with Allison’s affection for Hank and John Green’s Dear Hank and John podcast, plus her experience appearing on the Cracked Gets Personal podcast of 27 September 2017 (which itself originated in a story published by Cracked about Allison back in February 2017).
