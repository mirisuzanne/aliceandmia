Topics include sorting out one's gender(how do we figure it out?), how we talk about our identities (cis, trans, former trans; male, female, or...?), Alice's transitions in 1961 and 1989 and Mia's more recent transition, dealing with family and others (ouch and ❤), living in secret (woodworking), getting outed, and so much more. Some 🤣 and some 😮. Topics introduced are discussed at greater length in Episode 2.

**03.45** Read Mia's *`Body and Gender Fragments`_*. (The reading in Episode 2 will be excerpted from this piece.)

**06.10** Alice says more about being ‘formerly trans’ in the next episode.

// [ 08.10    Mia: genderqueer, not clear on her own gender, etc. Is there a published story for this? ]

// [ 08.25 Mia: Lesbian, bi, or pan? Story link? ]

// [ 09.10    Mia: Femme-of-centre presentation...story about ? ]

// [ 11.05    Appreciating that we’re all navigating the ‘new’ gender landscape from a place of ignorance and trial-and-error.  Humility and awareness are key. ]

**12.20** Actually, Mia does say she’s a trans woman in the `stories Alice read`_. Alice is a ditz.

.. _stories Alice read: https://medium.com/@mirisuzanne/latest

// [ 18.10 Mia: Vagueness of boundaries and definitions of her transition. Story? ]

**21.00** `TrueTrans / transmedicalists / truscum`_.

.. _TrueTrans / transmedicalists / truscum: https://letsqueerthingsup.com/2015/12/12/why-arent-more-trans-people-denouncing-truscum/

// [ Self-identification vs external (TruTrans). Story? ]

**21.18** Mia wrote about the language around trans and gender identity in *`Some Clarifications on Trans Language`_*.

.. _Some Clarifications on Trans Language: https://medium.com/@mirisuzanne/some-clarifications-on-trans-language-4757f1464796

There are a lot of trans / gender glossaries out there, and all of them have problems born of a) the rapidly changing nature of current language around gender, and b) the inevitable biases of the authors.  With those caveats, one of the better glossaires available is `the one by Julia Serano`_.

.. _the one by Julia Serano: http://www.juliaserano.com/terminology.html

**22.19** ‘A man or woman of trans history...’, the one Alice couldn’t remember is ‘...of trans experience’.

**22.38** Alice wrote about the problem with ‘normal’ in *`‘We’re just normal, why do you call us cis?’`_* (*Disponible en español `aquí`_.*)

.. _‘We’re just normal, why do you call us cis?: https://crossingenres.com/were-just-normal-why-do-you-call-us-cis-729891148615

**22.55** Queer theory ‘focuses on mismatches between sex, gender and desire’. —Annamarie Jagose, from `Queer Theory: An Introduction`_.

.. _Queer Theory: An Introduction: http://www.worldcat.org/title/queer-theory-an-introduction/oclc/35651102

**26.34** Alice ‘popped out into the trans community in June of 2016’; see her story *`The Kindness of Strangers`_*.

.. _The Kindness of Strangers: https://medium.com/p/the-kindness-of-strangers-75844656e643

**27.52** `Kate Bornstein`_ was indeed ‘around at about that time’ (late 1980s), transitioning three years before Alice in 1986.  She became publicly visible beginning in the 1990s—her famous appearance on the Geraldo Rivera Show was ‘1992-ish’, according to her—thus ‘shortly thereafter’. (If anyone has a link to a clip of that appearance, let us know!)

**30.02** For a good portion of those 27 years Alice wasn’t exactly white and def wasn’t living in suburbia. She tells some of that story in *`I Am (Not) Native American`_*

**32.20** *`Twined Fragments`_* is an ongoing collaboration between authors Allison Washington and Miriam Suzanne. Each fragment is sparked by the previous, as two trans women pass their memories back and forth, reflecting on lives and transitions separated by a generation.

**36.20** Mia and Alice aspire to age as coolly as Dame Judi Dench: (Photo: Jimmy Fontaine for *`The New York Times`_*.)

**38.50** The *Knowledge Effect* or *Prior Knowledge Effect* is a special case of *`Hindsight Bias`_* and the *`Curse of Knowledge`_* cognitive biases; wherein once someone knows something, they cannot imagine not knowing that thing.  This effect is central to a trans person’s inability to determine whether or not they are ‘passing’: Once you ask, then the person knows, and then has trouble imagining that they did not know (they minimise their previous lack of knowledge).

.. _hindsight bias: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias

.. _curse of knowledge: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge

This is illustrated by a game Alice calls *Spot the Tranny*: In a public place with women around, choose any woman who is, shall we say, ‘non-Barbiesque’.  Now say to yourself ‘that there is a trans woman’.  You will now begin to pick out increasingly obvious ‘tells’—height, hand size, larynx, hairline, jawline, brow, shoulders—practically against your will. Even just pretending you ‘know’ invokes the *Curse of Knowledge*. There is, of course, only `a 6/1000`_ chance that the poor dear is, in fact, a trans woman.

At the other extreme, good luck finding tells on `Carmen Carrera`_. Take-away: if you think you see a trans woman, the chances are quite good that you don’t.

  `Carmen Carrera`_: What trans women really look like.

  .. _Carmen Carrera: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Carrera

And whilst we’re here, another cognitive bias that plays a huge role in the marginalisation of trans people is *`Confirmation Bias`_*: the tendency to search for, interpret, focus on, and remember information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions. 

.. _Confirmation Bias: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias

**41.10** Alice transitioned at 32, but ‘you were also four’: Alice wrote about growing up as a girl in her `*Girl* series`_. She was de-transitioned by her father in 1971 at age 14, thereafter living sometimes ‘as a man’ (a.k.a. ‘boy mode’), sometimes in a semi-female-presenting, ambiguously-gendered state, until she re-transitioned, socially and medically, in 1989.

**44.58** Neural rewiring / `cortical remapping`_: When sensory input ceases (as from amputation) there can be a period of ‘ghost’ sensation, or ‘`phantom limb`_’ (and yes, this can happen with you-know-what), then over time the neural ‘circuits’ get reused for other things and we lose the ability to remember how those sensory inputs once felt; to the point that, decades later, Alice cannot remember what it felt like to have a beard or...yea, *that*. Ref: *`Phantom Penises In Transsexuals`_*.

**48.40** The shopping scene: `Julia Serano`_ tells a nearly identical story in *`Whipping Girl`_*. This exact scene probably plays out for many transitioning trans women.

**49.50** Can you imagine this with a beard?  😂

**52.14** Mia’s longer article about the family trip to Moab, pronouns, and the pain of misgendering, is *`(Mis)Gender`_*.

Inspiration for the *Alice & Mia* show came from working together on the *Twined Fragments* project, combined with Allison’s affection for Hank and John Green’s `*Dear Hank and John* podcast`_, plus her experience appearing on the *Cracked Gets Personal* podcast of 27 September 2017, *`Black Market Hormones & More Tales From The Trans Dark Ages`_* (which itself originated in a `story published by *Cracked* about Allison`_ back in February 2017).
